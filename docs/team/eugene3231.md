## Project: CliniCal

CliniCal is a desktop app that allows doctors to manage patient records and schedule upcoming appointments.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  * What it does: Allows the user to undo all previous commands that modify the patient database, one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. 
  The implementation was demanding as it required changes to existing commands and continuous updates for new commands added at each iteration. This included new commands such as adding, editing, deleting of visits and appointments added in `v1.3`
  * Credits:
    1. Existing AB3 codebase: [AddressBook Level-3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3)
    2. Design pattern consideration: [Best Practice for Undo Redo implementation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1915907/best-practice-for-undo-redo-implementation)
    
* **New Feature**: Added commands to edit and delete an existing visitation log.
  * What it does: Allows the user to modify or remove the existing visitation log seen from the profile window that had been implemented.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to amend visit details when the user makes a mistake or wants to make amendments to an existing visit summary. Also allows the user to organize the visitation logs and remove visits that are not required anymore.
  * Highlights: Also implemented the functionality of a new popup window to modify visit details, as stated below. And integrated undo and redo functions for the visit commands.

    1. Existing AB3 codebase: [AddressBook Level-3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3)

* **New Feature**: Implemented a pop-up window to add and edit a visitation log.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add or modify visit details such as diagnosis, prescription and comments in a user-friendly interface.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as there is a new interface for the user to manage visit details other than the main GUI.
  * Highlights: Created UI mockups and adapted this pop-up window for use in add visit and edit visit commands.
